### Task: Able to easily view and add their pet's activities

Scenario #1: Imagine you are a new pet owner and want to make sure your pet is meeting all their needs. You want to be able to keep track of your pets activities throughout the week so you can go back and check that they are meeting all their food and activity needs. Luckily, you've heard about the PetBite app and hear that there is a way to keep track of such activities. Add an activity or two to the pet activity list and view their information.
<br> Successful behavior: Successfully create pet activities and able to view and keep track of them easily.

### Task: Able to create and maintain a consistent daily feeding schedule for the user to follow 

Scenario #1: Imagine you are a new pet owner and while you've done your research, there's so much to keep track of. You heard of an app called PetBite from a friend and downloaded it. You want to be able to easily input times and amounts to feed your pet so when it's time to feed your pet you get a notification with details on how much to feed your pet. Create a schedule for your pet to follow throughout the week. 
<br> Successful behavior: New user is able to input feeding schedule information and receive notifications at the provided times

### Task: Able to keep track of their pet's weight overtime

Scenario #1: Imagine you are the owner of an older pet who has started to gain weight. You are concerned and begin an effort to get their weight back to a healthy level. You have downloaded the PetBite app and have your pet's information filled in, but you want to keep track of your pet's weight over an extended period of time to see their progress.
<br> Successful behavior: User is able to input new weights and still have a way to view what their pet's old weight was and how much porgress they've made.

### Task: Able to add multiple different pets and keep track of them seperately

Scenario #1: Imagine that you are the owner of many different pets. You love animals and wanted to experience taking care of many different kinds of species. However, many of these pets have different schedules so it's not as easy to keep track of their food intake, activities throughout the week, and feeding is not as simple as feeding everyone at "lunchtime". Luckily, the PetBite app has the ability to add multiple pets and keep track of them at the same time. Add additional pets past the first one and add activities and a schedule to each of them.
<br> Successful behavior: User is able to add and track multiple different pets.
