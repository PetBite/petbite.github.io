Scenario #1: Imagine you are a new pet owner and while you've done your research, there's so much to keep track of. You heard of an app called PetBite from a friend and downloaded it.

Scenario #2: Imagine that you are the owner of many different pets. You love animals and wanted to experience taking care of many different kinds of species.
