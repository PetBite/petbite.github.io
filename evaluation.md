## User Goals
- Able to quickly upload/modify their pet's information (name, breed, weight, age, etc...).
- Able to easily view and add their pet's activities.
- Able to maintain an accurate and consistent daily feeding schedule for their pet.
- Able to add multiple different pets and track them seperately

## Scenarios
### Task: Quickly upload/modify pet's information

 - Scenario: Imagine you are a pet owner and recently discovered the PetBite app. You log in and are prompted to add your pet information to begin using the app. Add pet information and begin using the app. 
- Successful behavior: Successfully entering all required pet's information quickly and create a profile.

### Task: Able to easily view and add their pet's activities

- Scenario: You were told that the PetBite app has a way to add and track pet activities and you think it's a good way to ensure your pet is getting the exercise it needs. Add a pet activity and view its details. 
- Successful behavior: Successfully create pet activities and able to view and keep track of them easily.

### Task: Able to create and maintain a consistent daily feeding schedule for the user to follow 

- Scenario: You were told that there is a way to establish and keep track of a feeding schedule for your pet in the PetBite app. Create a feeding schedule for the week.
- Successful behavior: User is able to input feeding schedule information for the week

### Task: Able to add multiple different pets and keep track of them seperately

- Scenario: Imagine that you are the owner of multiple pets. Many of these pets have different schedules so it's not as easy to keep track of their food intake, activities throughout the week, and feeding is not as simple as feeding everyone at "lunchtime". Add an additional pet(s) and add activities and a feeding schedule for it. 
- Successful behavior: User is able to add and track multiple different pets.

## Raw Data

<b> A (Emulator): </b>
- Task 1: User went through the input fields and filled them out normally, then clicked the submit button. 
- Task 2: User added an activity and was able to view it easily. 
- Task 3: Screen was bugged and user was not able to add a feeding schedule effectively. 
- Task 4: User was able to find the add pet option and added a pet normally.

<b> B (Emulator): </b>
- Task 1: User went through the input fields and filled them out normally (albeit with wacky information due to lack of form validation), then clicked the submit button.

- Task 3: Screen was bugged and user was not able to add a feeding schedule.

<b> C (Own device): </b>
- Task 1: User went through the input fields and filled them out normally, then pressed the submit button.
