## Motivation

There are many people who are or want to be pet owners, but don't know all there is to know regarding pet nutrition and health. PetBite seeks to change that by making it quick and easy to see what a pet's nutritional needs are. 

## Goals

Our primary goal is to have a functioning mobile application in which users can receive direct feedback regarding their pet's nutritional needs based on pet information such as weight, height, breed, and age. The application will provide feedback via chatGPT as well as other users who have similar pets. In service of making pet nutrition and health easy to digest, we also have a tracker that keeps track of a pet's meal and exercise times, as well as a pet food page with information and links to buy brands of pet food. Lastly, our application also aims to encourage community interaction and will have a message board where users can create and respond to posts.  

## Usage

Users will be able to login through this page using their credentials, or through a linked facebook/apple account. If a user has forgotten their password or doesn't have an account, they can press the "Forgot Password?" or "Register" buttons respectively to be redirected to the appropriate page.

</p>

* ### Home Page
After logging in, the user is presented with the home page. If the user is new to the application, they would be asked to enter and upload information about their pet. Once the pet's information is entered, the user would see an overview of their pet's information and AI-generated tips for their pet. The user can also update their pet's information later on. If the user has multiple pets entered into the application, they can switch to different pets by swiping up on this page and a navbar would appear at the top of the page. The navbar contains a row of the owner's pet pictures and the user can switch to different pet's page by clicking on one of the pictures.

</p>

* ### Feeding Schedule Page
Users can choose between an AI-generated feeding schedule or enter their own feeding schedule for their pet. The schedule card can be swiped to different days of the week and each card would display what the pet should eat on that day. The card displays various information such as the time of the meal, the amount of the meal, and a checkbox for completion. The feeding schedule can also be synchronized with the pet's activity and health, so the schedule can be adjusted in real time as needed.
