## Motivation

There are many people who are or want to be pet owners, but don't know all there is to know regarding pet nutrition and health. PetBite seeks to change that by making it quick and easy to see what a pet's nutritional needs are. 

## Goals

Our primary goal is to have a functioning mobile application in which users can receive direct feedback regarding their pet's nutritional needs based on pet information such as weight, height, breed, and age. The application will provide feedback via chatGPT as well as other users who have similar pets. In service of making pet nutrition and health easy to digest, we also have a tracker that keeps track of a pet's meal and exercise times, as well as a pet food page with information and links to buy brands of pet food. Lastly, our application also aims to encourage community interaction and will have a message board where users can create and respond to posts.  

## Usage

* ### Login Page
Users will be able to login through this page using their credentials, or through a linked facebook/apple account. If a user has forgotten their password or doesn't have an account, they can press the "Forgot Password?" or "Register" buttons respectively to be redirected to the appropriate page.

* ### Home Page
After logging in, the user is presented with the home page. If the user is new to the application, they would be asked to enter and upload information about their pet. Once the pet's information is entered, the user would see an overview of their pet's information and AI-generated tips for their pet. If the user has multiple pets entered into the application, they can switch to different pets by swiping up on this page and a navbar would appear at the top of the page. The navbar contains a row of the owner's pet pictures and the user can switch to different pet's page by clicking on one of the pictures.

* ### Feeding Schedule Page
Users can choose between an AI-generated feeding schedule or enter their own feeding schedule for their pet. The schedule card can be swiped to different days of the week and each card would display what the pet should eat on that day. The card displays various information such as the time of the meal, the amount of the meal, and a checkbox for completion. The feeding schedule can also be synchronized with the pet's activity and health, so the schedule can be adjusted in real time as needed.

* ### Activity Log Page
Users can log their pet's daily activities on this page. Logs are tracked in a simple scrolling list of activities, all of which are time stamped. The plus button on the bottom right allows the user to add activity logs. Activities are also separated by day markers.

* ### Community Forum Page
Users can communicate with other users in this application through this page, which includes a scrolling bar at the top of the application with circles representing different communities. The selected community is highlighted at the top to indicate which community the user is currently in. Below that are post previews from other users. Each post preview includes a like, comment, and share button/status. The preview shows the post's title, content, and images, if uploaded. When a user clicks on one, the page changes to the post page where they can view the post in more detail. At the bottom of the page is a plus sign that allows the user to write their own post. Clicking this button takes the user to the Create Post page.

* ### Pet Details Page
Users can input information about their pet on this page. Each pet an owner registers in the app will have their own details page, and it is here where users will be able to update information or delete new pets. Text boxes will be available for all the different aspects of their pet, including things like name, weight, breed, etc. It is also from here that the app will gather information about the pet and determine nutritional suggestions.
